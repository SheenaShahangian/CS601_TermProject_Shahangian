                    A huge part of why I travel is so that I can find epic destinations for my elopement photography clients. 
                    Choosing an incredible place to share your vows is a huge part of the process, and it's my job to help my 
                    couples identify those special spaces.

                <h3>Creating Travel Guides for Adventurers</h3>

                <!-- introductory content hinting at what you will find on the shop page -->
                <p class="info_card_paragraph">
                    In the process of traveling to find elopement locations for my couples, I realized that the general public 
                    also wanted resources to help them craft their own travel itineraries to the states I frequent. It's because 
                    of this need that I've expanded my business offerings to include guides and resources to travelers. Much of 
                    my travel calendar focuses on this purpose.

                In all of my travels, there are some locations that continue to stand out. You might say they haunt me, and 
                I can't help but feel a pull towards these places. These are the locations I want to find myself at again 
                and again and again, without fail. Let me share a glimpse of what makes them so special.
