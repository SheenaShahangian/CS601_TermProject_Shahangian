                    A huge part of why I travel is so that I can find epic destinations for my elopement photography clients.

                    In the process of traveling to find elopement locations for my couples, I realized that the general public 
                    also wanted resources to help them craft their own travel itineraries to the states I frequent. It's because 
                    of this need that I've expanded my business offerings to include guides and resources to travelers. Much of 
                    my travel calendar focuses on this purpose.

            <p id="p_near_aside">
                In all of my travels, there are some locations that continue to stand out. You might say they haunt me, and 
                I can't help but feel a pull towards these places. These are the locations I want to find myself at again 
                and again and again, without fail. Not only has each of these spots qualified as an incredible spot to get 
                married, but they have each felt like uniquely wonderful places to dedicate a week or more to traveling. 
                Whether you're looking to immerse yourself in the great outdoors through an extensive backpacking adventure, 
                or you prefer a more tamed experience of sitting an watching the sunrise at the trail head, each of these 
                locations has noteworthy adventures to offer.

                you had lost? That's how every single one of these incredible destinations has made me feel at some point. 
                Let me give you a glimpse into what makes them all so incredible.
