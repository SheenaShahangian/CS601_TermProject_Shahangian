# Read Me - MET CS 601 Sheena Shahangian

This iteration of my website contains the HTML for 8 fully designed and styled pages. The homepage is the filename "index.html". I have placed the stylesheet (styles.css) in the css directory, and all photos and icons within the "multimedia" directory. 

JavaScript can be found in the js directory. To keep my code organized, I have split out my project into several JavaScript files with intentionally self-explanatory filenames). Please note: I have seven pages in the navigation bar, but eight pages total. The eighth page is simply a form submission confirmation page, which should never be included in a main navigation, as that wouldn't make sense. However, this page does have the navigation bar on it, to encourage users to keep perusing the site after they have submitted their form. 

Please see below for a description of where I have included the requested elements (and where I have provided extras).

The website has been tested in Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. It has also been tested for responsiveness on different screen sizes.

## A Couple Notes Before We Begin

* All pages are styled using the same single external stylesheet, per the recommendation provided during week 2. As it is quite long, I have used comments to organize the code and make the stylesheet easy and clean to navigate. Media styles for tablet screen sizes and mobile screen sizes are located at the bottom of the stylesheet for easy reference, and thorough comments are provided thoroughout those sections as well.

## Requested Elements

### The Intended Audience

Before diving into how I've met and exceeded requirements, it's important to note who the intended audience of this website is. For a living, I am a professional photographer who specializes in photographing small weddings (referred to as elopements) in adventurous locations (e.g., the mountains). To use the industry terminology, I am what is called an "adventure elopement photographer." My business's website focuses solely on this, with the intent of functioning as a sales funnel to get clients to inquire and book with me. My business's website (not to be confused with this term project, to be clear) is not a portfolio, but rather what I refer to as my "inquiry machine."

As such, before this course, I didn't really have a portfolio that showed off my overall creative skillset, beyond photographing adventure elopements. I, for example, also take and sell my landscape photographs. Furthermore, I am an avid traveler, and hope to provide travel advice and guidance to people visiting the mountain west. I'd love to have a portfolio that showcases that imagery and expertise. I also work as a freelance writer for a major wedding blog, and I want my portfolio to show off that work as well. In essence,  I wanted this term project to be my creative portfolio, showing off all the creative and artistic endeavors I work on as a creative professional. This site, while touching on my work as an adventure elopement photographer, is intended to go beyond that. It is intended to show that I am a well-rounded creative professional with a skill set beyond simply photographing weddings.

All of that said, there are a few target audiences for this site. The first would be any online publication that focuses on either the outdoors or wedding industry, looking for a freelance writer with expertise in these fields. This site, with its plethora of content and photographs within these niches, fully exemplifies my qualifications for freelance gigs like these.

Another target audience would be outdoors brands who want to work with a photographer who is well-versed in the outdoors space. I have yet to pursue commercial outdoors photography, beyond adventure elopements, but the idea interests me. I want a site that shows off that something like that could be in my wheelhouse, should the opportunity present itself.

The last target audience would be anyone interested in buying landscape prints from someone who spends much of her life and work in the great outdoors. I'm a big believer in always finding a way to monetize a website, and in this example, adding a landscape photography storefront was a perfect fit. While this is a portfolio site, there is no reason why I can't also point visitors towards making a purchase if they like my work.

### Design and Layout

* The layout and design of the site are intended to take a colorful, yet minimalist approach. I did not want to overload the site with information and design elements that would detract from the content. Yet, I still wanted to ensure there was a cohesive brand associated with this site. This approach makes sense, as this site is meant to emanate an aura of professionality. It is not intended to be too showy or over-the-top. Yet, I also wanted it to have enough color and design to maintain the visitor's interest.
* I custom created my own site logo and intentionally narrowed down on a refined color palette to use througout the site. The color palette is consistent on every single page, and they use the same stylesheet intentionally. Furthermore, I also custom designed all of my own icons for this website, rather than downloading icons off the web. I wanted to provided a fully customized and branded experience to the viewer.
* All pages on the website clearly belong to the same site, an the design and layout are consistent. I have intentionally used class selectors in my css to allow the reuse of designs on various pages. This further enhances the consistency in design and layout on the page.
* As I speak to in greater detail in the CSS section, the site is responsive to three different screen sizes. I want to ensure my site functions for the greatest number of users as possible.

### Text

* I have opted to use typefaces that are clean and legible. All typefaces used are san serif, as those are most legible when read on the screen (as indicated in our textbook).
* I have chosen to only use 2 typefaces, per standard graphic design recommendation to not have too many typefaces in a single design. However, to ensure variety, I have leveraged various weights of the two typefaces. You will notice there feels like a variety of typefaces are used, while still remaining cohesive in style. This is acheived by using a variety of weights and casing, all within the same font family.
* All content has been proof-read for quality, presentation, and errors. My IDE performs appropriate spell-checking as well.

### Navigation

* All pages on the website can be accessed via the main navigation bar. The access the home page, you can click the logo, as is customary in modern-day websites. The only exception to this linking structure is the contact form confirmation page (confirmation.html). This is because it is not customary to have a success page like this in the main navigation. It should only be visible once the user completes the call to action (in this case, submitting the form). You will notice, however, that this page does still have a navigation bar at the top, to encourage users to keep browsing, even after submitting the form. On desktop, I also have the contact navigation link as underlined (to show it's active) when you're on the confirmation page, because that makes stylistic sense, given that the user has just completed the contact form.
* The main navigation bar is crafted with a clean and uncluttered design to make traveling through the site easy.
* The website is well-organized, and the names of each tab in the navigation are abundantly clear as to what you can expect to see on the page. This is with the intent to increase click-through rates. The relationships between the pages is clear, and internal linking is provided throughout the site where it makes sense.
* All hyperlinks, whether in the navigation and beyond, are meaningful in their names.
* All page titles are appropriate and refer exactly to what that page is about.
* As the screen size narrows, I have ensured that line height is abundant enough so that links don't stack on top of each other or feel to close. I intentionally left plenty of breathing room.
* I have personally found hamburger menus on mobile to be somewhat clunky, so I have opted for my own stacked navigation bar design, where all links are visible, much like they are on desktop.

### High Quality Imagery

* All images in the HTML have alt text attributed to them.
* Images have dimensions included where appropriate, however as requested, I would like to mention that explicit width and height are not always incorporated, as I have certain images that I wanted to take up a certain percentage of their containers (e.g., hero images that take up 100% container width). For these, including explicit width and height would not have been appropriate and would have negatively impacted an intentional design choice.
* All images were intentionally chosen to match the aesthetic of the website, and they have all been run through an image optimizer before being added to the multimedia folder. This image optimizer does not impact quality of images, but reduces the file size to make the site load faster. I have also sized images so that they don't take up excessive space if it's not needed. For example, images that function as hero images naturally are larger file sizes. However, images I have used for two-column layouts or four-column layouts are smaller, as they will never take up the full screen size. Meanwhile, icons used throughout the site take on more of a thumnail or smaller size, as that is what is appropriate, given they will not be displayed in large formats.
* All images used on the website as custom images taken by myself. This is an important aspect of the theme of my website, as I am a professional photographer. 

### Mechanics

The site has been thoroughly tested to make sure there are no missing graphics or broken links. Tests have been conducted in the following browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. I have also tested out the website on various screen sizes and devices sizes (using Chrome Dev tools).

### HTML Mastery

* I have applied meaningful id and class names in the HTML to make the css more understandable and provide meaning to my various elements used.
* Comments are used throughout my HTML to ensure readability and for making future modifications easier. The markup is more navigable due to the comments.
* I have incorporated sematic HTML throughout the website, and have avoided using divs unless they genuinely were the most appropriate elements to use. You will notice all pages on the website include a header, main, and footer, at a bare-minimum. Beyond that, focus was put on ensuring I used as much sematnic HTML as possible.

### CSS Mastery

* Each element has at least one property value pair (and most of them have a lot more than just one, given I was aiming to create a professional design).

* In regards to creativity, I have attempted to treat this as a professional website, with clean branding, good amounts of whitespace, consistent brand palette/color usage, and the like.

* I have used media queries to ensure responsiveness for different screen sizes (I will speak to this in greater detail further down).

* I have used a variety of selectors, including class selectors, element/type selectors, id selectors, and descendant selectors. As much as possible, I have aimed to focus on element/type and class selectors to ensure greater reusability on the code.

* I have used Google Fonts rather than system fonts to give my website an elevated and customized look. However, I have also specified fallback fonts as well, in case my website visitors' devices cannot render the Google Fonts.

* I have intentionally chosen colors that are easily legible on various colors and surfaces on the website, so that nothing is difficult to read.

* I have intentionally limited my font families to two distinct primary fonts (both Google Fonts) in order to keep with design best practices of not having too many fonts on a single page.

* I have chosen and used a color palette that I have based my styles on to ensure consistency in branding. You will see those colors across the board on the website.

* I have included more than one property:value pair on nearly every selector I've used to make sure I fine-tuned my design. Specifically, all fonts are changed, colors are added, layout is modified, the pages are responsive, padding is modified, margins are modified, line height and letter spacings are modified, etc. This is by no means a comprehensive list, as it'd be quite long, but this is a sample of changes made.

* I have organized my css document with in-depth comments to ensure the design choices are clear and easy to find (which will make this website easier to modify in the future, when needed). I have also used comments to break up my stylesheet into sections that make it more digestible. This will make it easier to modify the css in the future.

* Per the professor's recommendation during lecture, I have placed all media queries at the bottom of the stylesheet for easy identification.

* Per the professor's recommendation during lecture, I have tried to use rems and percentages as much as possible, and have used pixels as little as possible.

* Per the recommendation in week 2's assignment, I have included all styles in one css file. This makes sense in this case, as the website is not a large enterprise endeavor. Should that change at any point, one could make the case for a multitude of stylesheets.

* I have incorporated several distinct differences based on screen size, as I wanted each device size to really be comprehensive and beautiful on its own (see media queries explanation further down for details). Specifically, I have used media queries on 32 different elements on screens with a max width of 640 pixels, and I have used media queries on 19 different elements on screens with a min width of 641 pixels and a max width of 1024 pixels. Generally speaking, the 641 - 1024 pixel screens have more real estate and thus incorporate a lot of the same structure and design as larger screens, which is why they have less elements leveraging media queries. On the other end of the spectrum, smaller screen sizes require much resizing and redesigning.

* It's important for me to acknowledge that I have incorporated divs, but I have only done this when absolutely necessary and when a semantic element wouldn't work and would produce a warning from the validator. While warnings are listed as acceptible, I wanted to avoid them as much as possible.

* There are several distinct differences in how the pages are presented based on screen size. Per the professor's recommendation, the branding and colors remain consistent, no matter the screen size. This is to ensure that the viewer doesn't get confused about which site they are on; it's best practice for the branding to stay the same. Where I have incorporated changes is in doing things like modifying the navigation bar for mobile, changing font size depending on screen size, hiding elements on smaller screens for a more streamlined view, changing text alignment on smaller screens to make reading easier, etc. I go into full detail on how media queries were used to accomplish this below. Before we begin, these are the screen sizes and names I'll be referring to in this report:

  1. Anything referred to as **tablet** is a screen size of: *minimum 641 pixels and maximum 1024 pixels*.
  2. Anything referred to as **mobile** is a screen size of: *maximum 640 pixels*.
  3. Anything referred to as **desktop** is the default and is *1025 pixels or more*.

  I have used media queries to make the following substantial changes using media queries, based on the aforementioned screen sizes. This is by no means a comprehensive list of changes made using media queries, however, as that would be extremely long:

  * On mobile, the logo image is no longer floated and is represented as a block level element so it can stack above the navigation links.
  * The navigation bar adapts based on screen size. From desktop to tablet dimensions, the navigation link font gets smaller to accommodate the smaller screen size, and a chunky underline is added to all navigation links.  In the mobile version, the links are stacked on top of each other, rather than horizontal. The font is also reduced in size, all links have a chunky underline, they are left aligned, and have had their padding and left margin modified to look good on a smaller screen size.
  * The h1 on tablet is smaller than desktop, the line height is modified, and the font weight is lighter. The h2 and h3 on tablet also have reduced font sizes and line heights as well. These changes made the text less large and intense when viewed on a smaller screen size like tablet.
  * The h1 on mobile is smaller than both desktop and tablet, the line height is modified, and the font weight is lighter. However, beyond that, the text is also aligned to the left, as it has been recommended in the design world for mobile versions to have left aligned text to make things easier to read. To accommodate the left alignment, the left and right margins had to be modified as well. This was to ensure there was enough space on either side of the text. The h2 and h3 elements on mobile also incorporate this reduction of font size, line height, the change to left alignment (in most cases), and the addition of margin on the left and right side. One thing to note: on mobile, the letter spacing on the h3 was also changed, as it looked too wide otherwise. It is now more condensed and cleaner.
  * Since mobile h3s are left aligned (in most cases), I wanted to override that feature for h3's used on the image gallery cards. So those were modified to still be center aligned.
  * The paragraph text size is also reduced in size on tablet, compared to desktop. On mobile, the paragraphs are even smaller, but the distinct difference is the change to left alignment, which incorporates the addition of margin on the left and right. I also modified the width of the paragraphs to be 80%, which makes for a cleaner and more streamlined design. The only exception to this on mobile is the price paragraph on the shop page's image gallery cards. For that text, I have used media queries to keep center aligned.
  * The image gallery cards (which represent the cards that the landscape prints are on) use media queries to have a width of 40% on tablet (compared to the default 22% on desktop). This allows the cards to take up more space on the smaller tablet size screen. Similarly, on mobile, a width of 80% is used to allow for each card to take up most of the width of the screen for a single column look on very small devices.
  * Similarly, the four column info cards (e.g., used on the home page), take up 22% width on desktop and tablet, yet on mobile, they transition to 90% width of the flex container they are in.
  * On tablet size screens, I used media queries to make my unordered lists have a larger width so that they take up more screen real estate. Their font size is also reduced to accommodate the smaller screen size. On desktop, the percentage of screen the unordered list took up was much smaller, to leverage whitespace. I have done a similar thing with mobile, increasing the width of the unordered list and reducing the font size.
  * On tablet, the td elements for my table have a reduced font size and a reduced line height to accommodate the smaller screen size. For mobile, I have reduced the font size and line height of the td elements even more, for the even smaller screen size. In addition, on mobile, I have also reduced the font size on the th elements.
  * On desktop, all three columns in the table on the biography page are visible. To make the mobile design more streamlined and less cluttered, I have hidden that last column using media queries for the publication location. For tablet, I have done the same, but for publication date/year.
  * On desktop and tablet, the aside takes up 40% of the width and gives a sort of multi-column effect with the content that sits next to it (I used float to accomplish this). On mobile, however, that didn't make sense, so I changed float to none so the aside could take up its own column and sit above the content it previously sat next to on tablet and desktop. The aside is now centered and takes an 80% width.
  * On desktop, the iframe used to embed YouTube videos on the biography page has a width of 60%, and media queries were used to change this to 100% for both tablet and mobile.
  * I have used Flexbox to create a two column layout on portions of the home page, the biography page, the travels page, and the form submission confirmation page. However, on mobile, I do not want two columns for these spots; I'd rather have one, so the content can be larger. Thus I have used media queries to do that and change the flex container to display as a block level element. The cards/contents in that container now have a width of 100% instead of 50%, as the 50% was only relevant for tablet and desktop.
  * Similarly, on the articles page, I have also used Flexbox to create a two column layout for displaying four of my articles. This two column layout is consistent on both desktop and tablet settings, but turns into a one column layout when you transition to mobile-like width.
  * Generally speaking, media queries are used on this site to make font size and text alignment feel proportionate to screens size. They are also used to ensure that multi-column layouts render as single column on mobile, as that makes more sense on that screen size. All of these changes are to increase readability, while still maintaining the intended design.

### JavaScript Mastery

### Vue Mastery

I have opted to go above and beyond by including Vue on more than one page on my website. As Vue is new to me, I wanted to ensure I experimented on multiple pages. The first place that Vue is used on the site is on the "shop.html" page. This page is where I have landscape prints listed for sale. The second use of Vue is on the "articles.html" page. I'll speak to each next:

#### Shop Page Use of Vue

One of the pages that uses Vue on my website is the shop page. Specifically, there is a section with the id of "shopapp" that is used to introduce the print shop and show eight prints that can be purchased that has used Vue. The corresponding JavaScript file that contains my Vue instance is named shopapp.js and is located in the js folder.

The name of the print shop and the print shop introductory paragraph are populated with data from the shopapp.js file, and I have used the double curly braces to do so. I have done the same to render data for each print's name, the price for each print (which was an excellent fit, since that price is the same for all prints, which makes price updates an easy update from one single location in the shopapp.js file), and the shop call-to-action button text on each print's button (again, which is the same, so using Vue's expressions to tie the data to the appropriate location in the HTML using double curly braces was a natural fit).

The images of each framed landscape print are clickable, and previously I had hard-coded in the URL into the HTML for this. With the introduction of Vue, I have used Vue data binding to link URLs specified in the shopapp.js file (which contains the Vue instance), to those href tags.

Lastly, I used v-on:click, which calls the window.open() method that I use to make the buttons clickable and redirect to my gallery delivery system where a user can actually complete a purchase for a print.

#### Articles Page Use of Vue

The other page on my site that uses Vue is the articles page. This page is used to display a collection of articles that I have written for various publications. Specifically, there is a section with the id of "articlesapp" that is used to introduce the articles and show four interactive cards with information about each article. The corresponding JavaScript file that contains my Vue instance is named articlesapp.js and is located in the js folder.

The h2 and introductory paragraph that introduce the articles page are populated with data from the articlesapp.js file, and I have used the double curly braces to do so. I have done the same to render data for each article's title/name, each article's publisher (which was an excellent fit, since one publisher is listed multiple times), each article's blurb of informational text that talks about what the article is about, and each article's call-to-action buttons' text (each card has two buttons, one that says "Read More" and one that says "Go to Article". Again, with the button text, the text is consistent across all article cards, so using Vue's expressions to tie the data to the appropriate location in the HTML using double curly braces was a natural fit).

On the articles page, I have truly tried to put Vue to the test to create an interactive page. You'll notice that when you first enter this page and go down to the section showing the cards with article information on them, that there are icons over each article title. I've designed custom icons for these, and when you hover on those icons, the icon design changes slightly and shows the name of the publication in small text. When you hover off, it then becomes the original article icon (which is a generic, non-publisher specific design). I have used v-show and boolean values to determine which icon is shown when, and I use @mouseover and @mouseleave to call methods located in my Vue instance which change those boolean values so that what shows varies depending on whether or not the icon is hovered over.

Furthermore, you'll notice each article's card at first contains a button that says "Read More". This can be clicked (and uses v-on:click) to show a blurb of text about what the article is about. You'll also notice that when this button is clicked, the blurb shows and the "Read More" button disappears. This is because the boolean value associated with v-show for that button has been modified. You'll also notice that the "Go to Article" button, which was previously not visible, is now visible, due to a change in its v-show boolean value. Thus, when you click "Read More", the "Read More" button disappears and you see a blur of text about the article and another button saying "Go to Article". This dynamic behavior leverages Vue.

Lastly, v-on:click is used on the "Go to Article" buttons to call the window.open() method, which then opens up the actual article's URL in a new tab when the button is clicked.

#### A Note About Validation

Please note that if you run the HTML on the shop.html page or the articles.html page, you will receive inevitable errors and warnings for the parts of the page that have incorporated Vue, as the validator does not understand Vue. That said, I have ensured that these pages passed all validations prior to the addition of Vue, and also double checked that all errors were Vue-related and not actual HTML errors.



### DOM Mastery

### Validation/Accessibility

* In order to make the website accessible, I have ensured that all images and appropriate and descriptive alt text. In addition to that, all form controls used on the site have labels included with them.

### Extra Credit - How I Went Above and Beyond

I've attempted to add some new features beyond the standard requirements listed in the rubric. These include: 

* I have incorporated Flexbox for some of my multi-column layouts (as I read online that floats are less and less common these days and should start to be phased out, although I did use floats too to get some practice in).

* I have used multiple ES6 functionality and higher, along with the content taught in Module 5. Specifically, I have used fetch to grab data from a JSON file I created. This file contains a list of places I have on my travel bucket list, which is pulled and populated in a list on the travels page on my website. For ES6 functionality and higher...

* I have created custom imagery for my website, including my own logo, and icons that I personally designed. All images used on the website are also images that I have taken.

* I have run all imagery through an image optimizer prior to being added to the website, to ensure they are not too large.
