            <h1>My Unexpected Path</h1>
            <p>
                My path in life has been <em>anything</em> but predictable. I graduated with an undergraduate  
                degree in business and marketing with the assumption I wanted to work at a huge advertising agency. 
                After living the ad agency life for a bit, I quickly realized it was not my type of place <em>or</em> 
                lifestyle. I'm a big believer that the work you do should have meaning or make an impact, and I wasn't 
                getting that feeling working in marketing and advertising. Every day felt the same; very tactical and 
                never looking at the bigger picture. Something simply felt off, and I had to do something about it.
            </p>

                        I've always been a creative soul. As a kid, I spent many an hour drawing, weaving, and immersing myself 
                        in various forms of crafts. I distinctly remembered how doing those things always brought me to life, and 
                        I began to wonder if being a creator would give me that sense of purpose and calm yet again. So in my 
                        free time in the evenings after work, I began looking into what it would look like to work as a 
                        photographer. The idea of capturing a single moment in time in a way that allowed you to re-live it 
                        fascinated me to no end, and I needed to know more.

                        I slowly compiled professional grade gear and took it out every weekend to practice. I dedicated as much 
                        of my time as possible immersing myself in photo courses and online learning. If I was going to do this and 
                        be in charge of capturing essential moments in people's lives, I had to be the best I possibly could. 
                        After dedicating countless hours to honing in on my craft, I launched my photo business. Needless to say, 
                        it was love at first shutter click. Things took off from there, and I quickly realized that I had found 
                        my match.

            <h2>Where I Find My Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                When <em>most people</em> think about weddings, they think of huge productions. They easily forget 
                about the <em>true</em> meaning behind these days; the fact that they're about connection and being 
                inspired by another human being so much you want to commit your life to them. Elopements allow couples 
                to get back to that meaning and intention: the <em>true</em> reason people get married in the first 
                place. Elopements are extremely small ceremonies, oftentimes with only the couple themselves present. 
                They don't incorporate all of the fuss that comes with large, traditional weddings, and it's this 
                stripped down and minimalist approach to getting married that brings me alive and fires me up.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's videos like the ones below that inspire me to do the job that I do, and for me to approach 
                my existence with intention, whether that's when I'm documenting someone's elopement day or 
                whether I'm simply hiking in the mountains.
            </p>
