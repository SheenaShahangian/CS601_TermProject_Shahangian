            <h1>A Life Well Documented</h1>

            <p>
                I believe in living a life that is well documented. As a professional photographer,
                everything I do is about capturing moments. For my everyday work, this means documenting
                adventurous small weddings (also known as elopements) in the great outdoors for my clients.
                However, it goes beyond that. A life well documented also means making sure I'm capturing
                the small moments, whether that's an image of the alpine lake I hiked to over the weekend
                or the window of the coffee shop I frequent in the mornings. It also means writing about
                those experiences too.
            </p>

            <p>
                I want this little space on the web do to exactly that: show you the intersections of my life
                and the complexities of both creating art for myself and for those around me. Being a
                professional photographer, it's easy to make documentation all about the client, but it doesn't
                have to be that way (nor should it!). This portfolio shows you the multi-faceted aspects of
                who I am both professionally and personally. <strong>Who is Sheena?</strong>
                Let's go on a journey to find out.

                        I like to joke that there's pretty much <em>nothing</em> normal about me. I'm both
                        creative and analytical. I'm introverted, yet also love getting to know people. I'm
                        an avid hiker and explorer, but I also consider myself a homebody. Curious to know
                        more about this strange gal?

                        I'm a big believer that part of living a well-rounded life means living a life of exploration.
                        When I have free time, I try as hard as I can to not be at home; to get out and experience
                        new trails, new mountains, new beaches, and new cultures. I've turned my photos of these
                        incredible places I've traveled to into landscape prints you can purchase. Ready to shop?
