            <h2>A Multi-Faceted Career Creative Professional</h2>

            <p>
                I believe in living a multi-faceted creative life and career. As a professional photographer,
                everything I do is about capturing moments. For my everyday work, this means documenting
                adventurous small weddings (also known as elopements) in the great outdoors for my clients.
                However, my interests and experience go beyond that. I am also a writer in both the wedding and 
                outdoors spaces, and I document more than just weddings. This includes capturing and selling photos 
                of my travels and the landscapes I come across.
            </p>

            <p>
                I want this little space on the web to do exactly this: show you the intersections of my life
                and the complexities of both creating art for myself and for those around me. Being a
                professional photographer, it's easy to make documentation all about my wedding clients, but it doesn't
                have to be that way (nor should it!). This portfolio shows you the multi-faceted aspects of
                who I am both professionally and personally. <strong>Who is Sheena?</strong>
                Let's go on a journey to find out.

            <h2>The Many Sides of Sheena</h2>
            <p>
                I joke that I like to wear all the hats when it comes to life. There's nothing predictable or expected 
                about my career or my personality. I'm a combination of a million different influences and life experiences, 
                and you'll likely get that feeling after browsing through my site. You really never know what's going to 
                pop up around any corner.
