            <p>
                I specialize in documenting adventurous weddings in outdoors locations. This page is a little 
                sneak peek into what my days look like.

            <h2>The Life of an Elopement Photographer</h2>

            <p>
                By night, I'm a student, but by day, I'm what's called an adventure elopement photographer.
                So what exactly is that? Essentially, I photograph couples who have chosen to get married in
                adventurous locations with no guests present (or a small number of guests). It's what we in
                the wedding industry lovingly refer to as adventure elopements.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are a number of things that go into my job, as it's a bit different than what your
                traditional wedding photographer might do. Here's a sample of the services I offer to my
                clients:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I help all my couples find an epic and adventurous spot to say their vows</li>
                <li>I craft complete timelines for their elopement day, from start to finish</li>
                <li>I provide vendor recommendations, including everything from flowers to dresses</li>
                <li>I provide my couples with over 100 pages worth of planning guides and resources</li>
                <li>And that's just the icing on the cake (pun intended!)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="h2_near_aside">Curious What an Elopement Day Looks Like?</h2>
            <p id="p_near_aside">
                Adventurous elopements are a strange concept to most people, but they're some of the most
                incredible types of weddings, if you ask me! At their core, my couples want their elopements to
                be a true representation of their relationship and the things they love to do together. As I tend
                to work with very outdoorsy couples, a component of adventure is ever-present on these elopement
                days. My couples turn their wedding day into a full day of exploration and adventure, and when
                they look back on the photos of their day, that's exactly what they get: that moment frozen in time
                forever. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words (cheesy, I know!), so here are some
                photos of some of my couples, so you can get a feel for what it is that I do.

            <h2>Frequently Asked Elopement Questions</h2>

            <!-- first question -->
            <article class="question_and_answer">
                <div class="question_and_icon" onclick="toggleDropdownAccordion(this)">
                    <h3 class="question_heading">Why do couples choose to elope?</h3>
                    <img src="multimedia/arrow-icon.png" alt="down arrow icon" class="arrow_icon"></a>
                </div>
                <p class="invisible">
                    There is a misconception in the wedding industry that couples choose to elope either for 
                    price reasons or because they aren't close with their families. Nothing could be farther from 
                    the truth. In fact, most of the couples I work with are aiming to have a luxury experiences, 
                    but rather than focusing on "things," they want to put the focus on adventure. Ultimately, they 
                    want their wedding day to be about having incredible experiences, rather than pleasing a room 
                    full of guests.

            <!-- second question -->
            <article class="question_and_answer">
                <div class="question_and_icon" onclick="toggleDropdownAccordion(this)">
                    <h3 class="question_heading">How long does an elopement typically last?</h3>

                </div>
                <p class="invisible">
                    This is another very misunderstood topic in the wedding industry. There is an impression people 
                    have of elopements: that they are hurried, secretive events that may only last an hour or two. 
                    In reality, most eloping couples are dedicating anywhere between 4 - 12 hrs of a day to their 
                    wedding day activities.

                    Elopement costs vary quite a bit. Some couples opt not to have any vendors involved, and simply 
                    get married at the cost of a marriage license. However, most of the couples I work with are investing 
                    tens of thousands of dollars into a full-day, adventurous experience. This includes myself as the 
                    photographer, lodging and travel fees, food (whether it's a picnic or private chef), etc.

                One of the things most couples struggle with at the start of elopement planning is 
                understanding how all the pieces fit together to create a full day, adventurous 
                wedding experience. I use timelines to help provide clarity. Here's an example of 
                how some of my couples would spend their time on an 8 hour elopement day.
