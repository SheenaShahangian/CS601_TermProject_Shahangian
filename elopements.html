            <h1>All About My Day Job - Documenting Elopements</h1>
            <p>
                By night, I'm a student, but by day, I'm what's called an adventure elopement photographer.
                So what exactly is that? Essentially, I photograph couples who have chosen to get married in
                adventurous locations with no guests present (or a small number of guests). It's what we in
                the wedding industry lovingly refer to as adventure elopements.
            </p>

            class="hero_image">

            <p>
                There are a number of things that go into my job, as it's a bit different than what your
                traditional wedding photographer might do. Here's a sample of the services I offer to my
                clients:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I help all my couples find an epic and adventurous spot to say their vows</li>
                <li>I craft complete timelines for their elopement day, from start to finish</li>
                <li>I provide vendor recommendations, including everything from flowers to dresses</li>
                <li>I provide my couples with over 100 pages worth of planning guides and resources</li>
                <li>And that's just the icing on the cake (pun intended!)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="h2_near_aside">Curious What an Elopement Day Looks Like?</h2>
            <p id="p_near_aside">
                Adventurous elopements are a strange concept to most people, but they're some of the most
                incredible types of weddings, if you ask me! At their core, my couples want their elopements to
                be a true representation of their relationship and the things they love to do together. As I tend
                to work with very outdoorsy couples, a component of adventure is ever-present on these elopement
                days. My couples turn their wedding day into a full day of exploration and adventure, and when
                they look back on the photos of their day, that's exactly what they get: that moment frozen in time
                forever. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words (cheesy, I know!), so here are some
                photos of some of my couples, so you can get a feel for what it is that I do.

                One of the things most couples struggle with at the start of elopement planning is 
                understanding how all the pieces fit together to create a full day, adventurous 
                wedding experience. I use timelines to help provide clarity. Here's an example of 
                how some of my couples would spend their time on an 8 hour elopement day.
